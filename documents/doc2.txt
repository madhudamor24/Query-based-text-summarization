Python ( programming language ) is an interpreted , high level , general purpose programming language. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991 , Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace. Python's features include,  Easy to learn  Python has few keywords , simple structure , and a clearly defined syntax. This allows the student to pick up the language quickly. Easy to read  Python code is more clearly defined and visible to the eyes. Easy to maintain  Python's source code is fairly easy-to-maintain. A broad standard library , Python's bulk of the library is very portable and cross platform compatible on UNIX , Windows, and Macintosh. Interactive Mode  Python has support for an interactive mode which allows interactive testing and debugging of snippets of code. Portable  Python can run on a wide variety of hardware platforms and has the same interface on all platforms. Extendable  You can add low level modules to the Python interpreter. These modules enable programmers to add to or customize their tools to be more efficient. Databases  Python provides interfaces to all major commercial databases. GUI Programming , Python supports GUI applications that can be created and ported to many system calls , libraries and windows systems , such as Windows MFC , Macintosh , and the X Window system of Unix. Scalable , Python provides a better structure and support for large programs than shell scripting.Python uses duck typing and has typed objects but untyped variable names.
