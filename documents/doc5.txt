NumPy , which stands for Numerical Python , is a library consisting of multidimensional array objects and a collection of routines for processing those arrays. Using NumPy, mathematical and logical operations on arrays can be performed. This tutorial explains the basics of NumPy such as its architecture and environment. It also discusses the various array functions , types of indexing , etc. NumPy targets the CPython reference implementation of Python , which is a non-optimizing bytecode interpreter . Mathematical algorithms written for this version of Python often run much slower than compiled equivalents . NumPy addresses the slowness problem partly by providing multidimensional arrays and functions and operators that operate efficiently on arrays, requiring rewriting some code, mostly inner loops, using NumPy . Using NumPy in Python gives functionality comparable to MATLAB since they are both interpreted, and they both allow the user to write fast programs as long as most operations work on arrays or matrices instead of scalars . In comparison , MATLAB boasts a large number of additional toolboxes , notably Simulink , whereas NumPy is intrinsically integrated with Python , a more modern and complete programming language .
