In computer programming , a data structure may be selected or designed to store data for the purpose of working on it with various algorithms. Each data structure contains information about the data values , relationships between the data and functions that can be applied to the data. Characteristics of data structures Data structures are often classified by their characteristics. Possible characteristics are : Linear or non-linear : This characteristic describes whether the data items are arranged in chronological sequence , such as with an array , or in an unordered sequence , such as with a graph. Homogeneous or non-homogeneous : This characteristic describes whether all data items in a given repository are of the same type or of various types. Static or dynamic : This characteristic describes how the data structures are compiled. Static data structures have fixed sizes , structures and memory locations at compile time. Dynamic data structures have sizes , structures and memory locations that can shrink or expand depending on the use.
